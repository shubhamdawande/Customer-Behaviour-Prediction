Customer Segmentation for Marketing, RFM Analysis, Purchase Day Prediction

### Problem Statement:
We help Rainbow Store understand and predict customer behaviours. Here we are dealing with storeâ€™s basket-level transaction data. The store manager wants to know which customers are likely to purchase next month so he can prepare his marketing campaign.

1. Implement a model that predicts which customers make at least 1 purchase in a given month using features generated from the 2 previous months.
For example, data from February and March can be used to predict purchases in April; data from March and April can be used to predict purchases in May.

2. You're asked which customers to send promotional e-mails to next month, based on your model. What is your recommendation?
